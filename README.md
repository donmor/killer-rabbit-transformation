# killer-rabbit-transformation
Minecraft mod that tweaks rabbits

### Summary
This mod makes killer bunnies able to spawn (incidence rate as low as 0.02% though). You can also turn an ordinary rabbit to a killer by using splash potion of weakness. Killer bunnies now also attack villagers, illagers, witches, zombies, creepers and skeletons. Zombies, creepers and skeletons killed by killer bunnies now drop their skulls (drop rate as high as 50%).
